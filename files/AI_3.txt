History of AI

The history of AI stretches from early philosophical ideas to today’s advanced technologies. Ancient civilizations imagined artificial beings, 
such as mechanical servants in Greek myths, showing that the dream of intelligent machines has existed for centuries. In the 20th century, the 
groundwork for AI was laid with Alan Turing’s 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, which proposed the famous Turing Test to 
measure machine intelligence. The official birth of AI as a field took place in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, where John McCarthy, Marvin 
Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon discussed the possibilities of machines simulating intelligence. Early optimism in the 1960s 
led to the creation of basic AI programs and expert systems, but limited hardware and unrealistic expectations resulted in periods of slowed 
progress, known as “AI Winters.” However, the 1980s revived interest with expert systems and symbolic AI. The real transformation began in the 
late 1990s and early 2000s when greater computing power, machine learning algorithms, and access to big data allowed AI to flourish. Notable 
milestones include IBM’s Deep Blue defeating world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, the rise of deep learning in the 2010s, and the 
development of powerful models for language processing, image recognition, and autonomous technologies. Today, AI continues to grow at an 
unprecedented pace, fueling innovations in nearly every industry.
