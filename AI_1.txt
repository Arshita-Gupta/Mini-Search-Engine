What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a specialized field of computer science that focuses on designing machines or systems capable of performing 
tasks that normally require human intelligence. It is based on the idea of simulating cognitive functions such as learning, reasoning, 
decision-making, and problem-solving using algorithms and computational models. AI systems are built to analyze data, recognize patterns, 
and make predictions or decisions with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional computer programs that follow explicit instructions, 
AI is adaptive and can improve its performance through experience. For example, virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, recommendation systems 
on Netflix or YouTube, and self-driving cars are all applications of AI. At its core, AI combines disciplines like mathematics, statistics, 
psychology, linguistics, and computer science to create intelligent systems. The goal is not only to mimic human intelligence but also to 
enhance human capabilities by automating repetitive work, processing vast amounts of data, and providing insights beyond normal human capacity.
AI has become a transformative technology of the 21st century, influencing nearly every sector including healthcare, finance, education, 
manufacturing, and communication.
