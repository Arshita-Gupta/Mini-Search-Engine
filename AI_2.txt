Types of AI

AI can be classified into two major categories: based on capabilities and based on functionality. In terms of capabilities, there are three 
main types. Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) refers to AI that specializes in a single task, such as voice assistants or spam filters. 
It is the most common form of AI in use today. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is the hypothetical stage where AI can perform any 
intellectual task like a human, showing flexibility and adaptability across domains. Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) goes beyond human 
intelligence and remains a futuristic concept that raises ethical and safety concerns. Based on functionality, AI is categorized as Reactive 
Machines, which only respond to current inputs without memory (e.g., IBMâ€™s Deep Blue chess program); Limited Memory AI, which uses past data to 
make decisions (e.g., self-driving cars); Theory of Mind AI, an advanced form that aims to understand human emotions and intentions; and 
Self-Aware AI, which is purely hypothetical and would mean machines gaining consciousness. These classifications highlight the journey of AI 
from basic automation to futuristic, human-like intelligence.
